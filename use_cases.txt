Use cases: 
    - 2D image detection (with or without tracking)

TODO:
    - 2D image and 3D point cloud data --> 3D Point "center" of the object 
    - 3D point cloud detection --> 3D BBoxes 

Not considered at the moment:
    - 2D images --> 3D BBoxes (annotation process difficult)
    - 2D images + point cloud --> 3D BBoxes (maybe in the future)
    - 2D image --> 2D Segmentation image (future)
    - 2D image --> Object distance (future)
